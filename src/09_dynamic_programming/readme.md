- ### Dynamic programming -> Fraction of an item

  When it is possible to take a fraction of an item. How do you deal
  with this using dynamic programming? Answer: you don't deal, because
  it's not possible. With dynamic programming, it's all or nothing.

- ### Dynamic programming -> Items with interdependence

  Dynamic programming only works when your Subproblems are discrete,
  that is, when they are not dependent on each other. It is useful when
  you are trying to optimize on relation to a limit.

- ### Feynman algorithm
  Write the problem. Think about it a lot. Write the solution.
