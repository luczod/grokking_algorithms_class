- ### KNN

  In a scatterplot, if most of the neighbors are made up of red,
  not green. Therefore, a dot is probably a red one.Even though it
  is simple, this algorithm is very useful.

- ### Grouping

  you group the points by similarity, but how do you find out
  how similar two points are? the dots can be anything like
  netflix users or fruits.

- ### Theorem of Pythagoras
  Find the distance between two points
  the two basic things you will do with the k-nearest
  neighbors algorithm: classification and regression.
