- ### Greedy algorithms

  Many people say that this algorithm seems easy. But it's obvious
  too much, so it must be wrong. However, that is the beauty of algorithms.
  greedy (also called greedy algorithms): they are easy!

- ### Approximation algorithm.

  When a lot of time is needed to calculate the exact solution, an approximation
  algorithm is a good idea it works. Approximation algorithms are evaluated

- ### Discover all possible subsets

  List each possible subset of stations. This is called a set of parts
  (also known as POWER SET). In this case, there are 2^n possible sets.

- ### Traveling salesman problem

  the traveling salesman has to visit 5 cities many different. He is trying to
  figure out the shortest route that will take him to the five cities. To find
  the shortest route, you must first calculate all possible routes.

- ### The starting location is unknown

  In Traveling salesman problem, the starting location can be is unknown.
  It's up to you to calculate the ideal route and departure location for
  the traveling salesman. you need to visit ALL the cities instead of
  simply going from point A to B.

- ### NP-complete
  each possible solution is calculated and chosen the smallest. These two problems
  (Traveling salesman and Power set) are NP-complete.
