- ### DC divide and conquer

  Following the DC strategy, with each recursion you must reduce
  your problem. The DC algorithm is not a simple algorithm that you apply to a
  problem, but rather a way of thinking about the problem.

- ### Quicksort

  choice pivot and Partition the array into two subarrays, separating them between elements
  smaller than the pivot and elements larger than the pivot. If the subarrays are ordered,
  you can combine them like this: left array + pivot + right array. Consequently,
  you will have a ordered array.

- ### Quicksort Big O
  In the worst case, quicksort has runtime O(n<sup>2</sup>). However, this is the worst case
  possible. In the average case, quicksort has O(n log n) execution time, as it depends on
  the chosen pivot
