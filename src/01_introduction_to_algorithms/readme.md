- ### Binary search

  binary search would only take 18 steps â€“ a big difference! In general,
  for a list of n numbers, binary search needs log<sub>2</sub>n to return the correct
  value, while simple lookup needs n phases

- ### Runtime linear vs Runtime

  With the simple search, Bob needs to check 100 elements, so the search
  takes 100 ms to run. In contrast, he only needs to check seven
  elements in binary search (log<sub>2</sub>100 is approximately 7), therefore, the
  Binary search takes 7 ms to execute.

- ### BigO

  Big O notation takes the worst-case scenario into account. So you can
  say that for the worst case, you analyzed every item on the list.
  This is the time O(n).

- ### Big O runtime examples

  O(log n) < O(n) < O(n \* log n) < O(n<sup>2</sup>) < O(n!)

- ### The speed of an algorithm
  The speed of an algorithm is not measured in seconds, but by
  growth in the number of operations.
